# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

Each semester, students come across some issues that require the attention of the college administration. More often than not, these issues are repetitive, which means a group of students have very similar problems and need to contact the administration separately. This leads to concerned authorities having to go through tens or hundreds of emails just to tackle the same problem again and again.

This usually happens because there is no way for students to determine if their issue has already been discussed by someone else. This platform, called the Issue Management portal, will help ease the process both for the administration and the student body. With this centralized system, students can look up for their issues in a list of previously discussed sections and find their answers faster and in an easier way. The administration doesn't have to deal with the same issue again and again. This platform will be specially tailored for IIITD to meet the needs of our student body and college administration.

## 1.2 Overview

This project aims to build a centralized system to discuss all the students' issues that require administrative help. This way, all the important information and discussions will be stored in one place and referred to by anyone in the future.

This platform will allow the students to find answers to the issues that have already been raised in the past. It also lets them make the administration aware of any new issues. Moreover, students can communicate the urgency of an unresolved issue by upvoting it so that the administration can get to it quickly.

Administration can discuss the issue with the students and forward it to different departments as required. They can also resolve the issue on the portal itself. Moreover, they can make announcements on the topics that need to be communicated to the entire (or selective) student body.

## 1.3 Intended Users

1.  Students
2.  College Administration: Financial department, Academic department, Placement cell, etc.
3.  Student Senate

## 1.4 Project Scope

The scope of the project is a web application hosted on IIITD server. It will be using frontend and backend technologies. Frontend for UI and backend for database handling and querying.

# 2. Specific Requirements

## 2.1. Features

The Issue Management Portal has the following features for all its users:

(The 2 stakeholders (student and administration) have a different set of features.)

### Student

#### 1. Query

- A student can post an issue on the portal.
- They can view all public issues posted by other students.

#### 2. Filter

- Option to sort/view the issues based on department, programme (B-Tech/M-Tech/PhD), Batch year or query type (Academic/ Non-Academic).

#### 3. Tags

- issues posted by the students can be marked as public/private. If marked as private, the query can only be seen by the admins.
- issues can be labelled based on concerned departments and programmes. (It will be used in filtering as mentioned in point 2)

#### 4. Avoiding duplicate issues

- While entering a query, if the studentâ€™s query matches with an existing query in the database, then the student will be shown the past query and its reply (if any).
- If the student feels that his/her query is still unresolved, he will be allowed to post his/her query. But to avoid misuse of this feature, admins hold rights to block a student who repeatedly asks the issues which have already been answered.

#### 5. Upvoting & Commenting on an issue
